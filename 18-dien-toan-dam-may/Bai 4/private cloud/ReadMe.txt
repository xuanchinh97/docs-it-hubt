=== Installation Notes (Backup Cow Private Cloud Suite) ====

This software package contains two parts: BackupCowClient_Setup.exe and BackupCowServer_Setup.exe

Run BackupCowClient_Setup.exe on each client computer to install the client program. 
Run BackupCowServer_Setup.exe on each server to install the server program.

Then users can back up files from the client machines to the servers.

Therefore, this software can help you:
1. Implement simple client/server backup: Back up files from client computers to a central server.
2. Implement internal private cloud backup: Back up files from client computers to internal cloud storage that is built with a couple of servers.

** How to Build Internal Cloud Storage **
The software can transform any Windows computers on the same local network to be internal private cloud storage:
Install the server program on each computer that will be a cloud server, then all these servers will connect together automatically to be the in-house private cloud.

And any user can run the client program on his/her computer, and back up files to the internal cloud storage (cloud servers)


** Signup and Login **
Any user must sign up an account from the client program in order to back up files to servers thereafter. 
Then the user will log in the server with the account information.

If the user logs out, she or he must log in to let the client machine connect to the servers again.
